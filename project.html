          when it was added to the 23rd Olympiad in the Greek Olympics. It was under the name 
          of "Pugilism", and it was very different from what modern day boxing is like now,
          and for the better.

      <h2> What Are the Rules in Boxing? </h2>
      
      <p>
          According to the Association of Boxing Commissions and Combative Sports (A.B.C.C.S),
          the first rule of boxing is: Each round (out of 12 total) will consist of 3 minutes,
          with a 1 minute break in between rounds.
          The second rule of Boxing is that the referee is the sole arbiter of a bout and is
          the only individual authorized to stop a contest. The third rule of Boxing is that
          all bouts will be evaluated and scored by three judges.
          The fourth rule in Boxing is that the 10 Point Must system will be the standard system
          of scoring a bout. The fifth rule is that the Mandatory (8) count after knockdowns will
          be standard procedure in all bouts. The sixth rule in boxing is all professional boxers
          are required to wear a mouthpiece during competition. The round cannot begin without the mouthpiece.
          If the mouthpiece is dislodged during competition, the referee will call time and have
          the mouthpiece replaced at the first opportune moment, without interfering with the immediate action.
          Points may be deducted by the referee if he feels the mouthpiece is being purposely spit out.
          The seventh rule is that there is NO standing eight count. The eighth rule is that there is NO (3) 
          Knockdown rule. The 9th rule is a boxer shall receive a twenty (20) second count if the boxer is
          knocked out of the ring. The boxer is to be unassisted by spectators or his/her seconds. If assisted
          by anyone, the boxer may lose points or be disqualified with such a decision being within the sole
          discretion of the referee.

      <h2> The History of Boxing and its Heroes.</h2>
      
      <p> Boxing's History is thousands of years long, and it is still evolving and being rewritten
          to this day. In its early stages Boxing was an olympic sport used to display battle without
          the use of any external weapons. Boxing did not have the rules it had today but it
          ensured that both challengers would only be using their glove-covered hands. The downside
          of the newborn sport though, is that there was no time limit, no weight classes or weight
          restrictions, and no scoring system. All of this just made it seem like a pointless fight
          to the death, and death was an exponentially higher likely outcome than it is with today's
          boxing rules. If you were an ancient boxer, the chances of you living a healthy life after
          starting your career were slim to none, with most boxers developing permanent paralysis or 
          early signs of brain damage within days of their first fight.

      <h2> The Most Famous Boxing Performances. </h2>
      
      <p> In modern day boxing, Many people have made a name for themselves. In this sport, you do 
          not have a team in the way that a basketball team has one. It is only you, and your coach,
          that is why its called the loneliest sport in the world. When your guard is down and
          you are losing points while simultaneously being punched to the point of no rational thinking,
          NOBODY can help you at all; Unlike basketball or soccer where you have teammates that can
          reciprocate for your mistakes. Having the courage to put those gloves on knowing
          only YOU have your own back, is what makes a fighter legendary. These fighters are on the
          list of the world's best, here are also some videos:
