      <h2> First of All, What is Boxing? </h2>
      <p> Boxing is a combat sport/martial art that gained fame for the first time in 688 B.C when it was added to the 23rd Olympiad in the Greek Olympics. It was under the name of "Pugilism", and it was very different from what modern day boxing is like now, and for the better.
      Boxing is a combat sport where 2 people fight using only their hands and gloves.</p>
